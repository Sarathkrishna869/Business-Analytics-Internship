This project, Big Sales Prediction, focuses on predicting sales for a large retail company. Here are the key points:

Objective: To Devolop a machine learning model using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to predict sales of products based on features such as item weight, visibility, MRP, outlet establishment year, and other relevant factors. By analyzing and preprocessing the given sales data, the goal is to build a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales and help businesses optimize their inventory and marketing strategies.

Methodology: Utilizes machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.

Conclusions: The model successfully predicts sales with a reasonable accuracy, helping the company in inventory management and sales strategy planning.
